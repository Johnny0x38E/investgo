# InvestGo

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md) | [License](./LICENSE)

InvestGo is a Wails desktop investment tracker for watchlists, holdings, portfolio analytics, hot lists, historical charts and price alerts.

InvestGo uses Wails mainly as a lightweight desktop container for a Go backend and Vue frontend. The packaged desktop app does not need to ship its own Chromium and Node.js runtime like Electron. For this project shape, Wails can usually deliver a much smaller app bundle, lower idle memory usage, and faster startup than an equivalent Electron app, while still providing native windowing, embedded assets, lifecycle hooks, DevTools support, and platform integration.

> - Electron has enabled many excellent cross-platform desktop applications, but it has also made repeatedly bundling the browser runtime a common overhead on many everyday devices. We need more lightweight cross-platform desktop solutions, reusing the system WebView as much as possible and keeping the native backend lean.
> - This project currently targets Wails v3 alpha.54. Wails v3 is still an alpha release, so official APIs, runtime behaviour, and build details may change in future Wails releases.
> - InvestGo is primarily a personal-use and learning project. It is open-sourced for reference, but long-term maintenance, compatibility, and feature roadmap are not guaranteed.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Go 1.24, Wails v3 alpha.54, standard HTTP handlers.
- Frontend: Vue 3, TypeScript, PrimeVue 4, Vite 8, Chart.js 4.
- Market data: EastMoney, Yahoo Finance, Sina Finance, Xueqiu, Tencent Finance, Alpha Vantage, Twelve Data, Finnhub, Polygon.
- FX data: Frankfurter.
- macOS packaging: shell scripts plus `swift`, `sips`, `iconutil`, `hdiutil`, and `ditto`.
- Windows build: PowerShell script plus `go`, `pnpm` (or `npm`), and Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.

## Architecture

The repository is not a monorepo. The Go module root is the repository root, and the frontend lives in `frontend/`.

- `main.go` embeds `frontend/dist` and `build/appicon.png`, creates the Wails v3 application, wires platform settings, and serves one HTTP mux.
- `/api/*` routes are handled by `internal/api`. The frontend talks to the backend with normal `fetch()` calls from `frontend/src/api.ts`; it does not use Wails JS bindings for app data.
- `internal/core/store` owns persisted state, runtime status, quote refreshes, history cache, overview analytics, alert evaluation, and JSON storage.
- `internal/core/marketdata` registers quote and history providers and builds the history router.
- `internal/core/provider` contains provider implementations.
- `internal/core/hot` owns hot-list pools, caching, enrichment, and sorting.
- `internal/platform` isolates desktop platform seams such as proxy detection and window options.
- `internal/logger` stores backend and frontend developer logs.

Persisted state defaults to:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/investgo/state.json`
- Windows: `%AppData%\investgo\state.json`

Developer logs default to:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/investgo/logs/app.log`
- Windows: `%AppData%\investgo\logs\app.log`

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20+
- Go 1.24+
- macOS 13+ on Apple Silicon or Intel for macOS build and packaging scripts
- Windows 11 x64 plus Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime for Windows desktop runtime

Windows prerequisites can be installed with:

```powershell
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
winget install GoLang.Go
winget install Microsoft.EdgeWebView2Runtime
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

> If you prefer npm, replace `pnpm` with `npm` in the commands below.

Run the frontend dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The dev server runs on port 5173. It does not provide the Wails runtime, so `frontend/src/wails-runtime.ts` must remain nullable-safe.

Run checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
env GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build-cache go test ./...
```

Build the frontend bundle:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Build the desktop binary:

macOS Apple Silicon:

```bash
./scripts/build-darwin-aarch64.sh
VERSION=1.0.0 ./scripts/build-darwin-aarch64.sh
./scripts/build-darwin-aarch64.sh --dev
```

macOS Intel:

```bash
./scripts/build-darwin-x86_64.sh
VERSION=1.0.0 ./scripts/build-darwin-x86_64.sh
./scripts/build-darwin-x86_64.sh --dev
```

Windows 11 x64 from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows-amd64.ps1
$env:VERSION="1.0.0"; .\scripts\build-windows-amd64.ps1
.\scripts\build-windows-amd64.ps1 -Dev
```

Windows 11 x64 from Command Prompt or Explorer:

```bat
scripts\build-windows-amd64.bat
```

The `.bat` wrapper runs the PowerShell build with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for this process and pauses when the build fails, which makes missing prerequisites or script errors visible instead of closing the window immediately.

The macOS build scripts render `build/appicon.png` with Swift/AppKit, run `pnpm build`, and output `build/bin/investgo-darwin-aarch64` or `build/bin/investgo-darwin-x86_64`.
The Windows build script copies `frontend/src/assets/appicon.png` to `build/appicon.png` when missing, runs `pnpm build`, and outputs `build/bin/investgo-windows-amd64.exe`. ImageMagick is only needed if `ICON_SOURCE` is overridden to point at an SVG file.
If `pnpm` (or `npm`), `go`, or optional `magick` are missing, the Windows build script prints the matching `winget install ...` command.

Build script environment variables:

- `VERSION`
- `APP_VERSION`
- `OUTPUT_FILE`
- `ICON_SOURCE` (Windows)
- `APP_ICON_OUTPUT_FILE` (Windows)
- `ICON_SIZE` (Windows)
- `DARWIN_GOARCH` (macOS)
- `DARWIN_PLATFORM_NAME` (macOS)
- `MACOS_MIN_VERSION`
- `GOCACHE`
- `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`
- `CGO_CFLAGS`
- `CGO_LDFLAGS`

## Package

Windows installer packaging is not implemented yet. The Windows script currently produces a runnable `.exe`; a proper installer still needs Windows-specific resource metadata, WebView2 handling, signing, and installer scripting.

Package the app bundle and DMG:

macOS Apple Silicon:

```bash
./scripts/package-darwin-aarch64.sh
VERSION=1.0.0 ./scripts/package-darwin-aarch64.sh
./scripts/package-darwin-aarch64.sh --dev
```

macOS Intel:

```bash
./scripts/package-darwin-x86_64.sh
VERSION=1.0.0 ./scripts/package-darwin-x86_64.sh
./scripts/package-darwin-x86_64.sh --dev
```

Outputs:

- `build/macos/InvestGo.app`
- `build/bin/investgo-<version>-darwin-aarch64.dmg`
- `build/bin/investgo-<version>-darwin-x86_64.dmg`

Unsigned macOS builds:

The public macOS artifacts are not currently Developer ID signed or notarized. After downloading a DMG or app bundle, macOS Gatekeeper may block launch, or show messages such as "InvestGo is damaged and can't be opened." For a build you trust, either use System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway after the first failed launch, or remove the quarantine flag manually:

```bash
# If the app has already been copied to /Applications:
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/InvestGo.app

# If macOS requires elevated permissions for the copied app:
sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/InvestGo.app
```

You can also clear the downloaded DMG before mounting it:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/investgo-<version>-darwin-aarch64.dmg
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/investgo-<version>-darwin-x86_64.dmg
```

Do this only for artifacts you built yourself or downloaded from a source you trust. Disabling Gatekeeper globally is not recommended.

Packaging script environment variables:

- `APP_NAME`
- `BINARY_NAME`
- `VERSION`
- `APP_ID`
- `MACOS_MIN_VERSION`
- `DARWIN_PLATFORM_NAME`
- `DARWIN_BUILD_SCRIPT`
- `VOLUME_NAME`
- `ICON_SOURCE`
- `APPLE_SIGN_IDENTITY`
- `NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE`
- `SKIP_APP_BUILD`
- `SKIP_DMG_CREATE`

## Runtime Notes

- `--dev` enables terminal logging and F12 Web Inspector support at build time. F12 still requires the in-app `developerMode` setting to be enabled.
- Version is injected with `-X main.appVersion=$APP_VERSION`. Without `VERSION` or `APP_VERSION`, the app reports `dev`.
- Proxy mode can be `none`, `system`, or `custom`. System proxy detection currently probes `scutil --proxy` only on macOS.
- Windows builds require WebView2 Runtime on the target machine. Windows 11 usually has it installed, but clean systems should verify it explicitly.
- The Windows build does not yet embed a `.ico`, version resource, or application manifest into the executable.
- Frontend visible copy is bilingual. User-facing text changes should update both `zh-CN` and `en-US` entries in `frontend/src/i18n.ts`.
- There are no frontend tests. Use `pnpm typecheck` for frontend validation and Go tests under `internal/**` for backend validation.
